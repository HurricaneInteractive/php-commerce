# PHP COMMERCE
Project I am building using PHP to make a very basic e-commerce website. At the moment is is purely experimental and probably shouldnt be used in any production websites.

### Setup
All you'll need is a development environment that supports PHP and you are able to connect to a MySQL server. I am using XAMPP.

Fork & Clone the project, update the `config.php` file to connect to your database and you are good to go!
